        <h1>Hello Queen of zodiac CANCER !!!!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to 2024, Cancer. Pluto, the badass planet of death and rebirth, embarks on a journey all year that is major for love and relationships. Let's talk about love first, shall we? The makeover planet is in Aquarius and your 8th House of Sex, Death, and Transformation starting on Saturday, January 20, encouraging you to expand what's on the sensuality menu, whether you're taking a break from dating, enjoying the fluidity of your orientation, or experimenting with kink and fantasy. Pluto dips into Capricorn and your 7th House of Partnership on Sunday, September 1, where it will stay until Tuesday, November 19, bringing big but welcome changes to your most important relationships. It moves back into Aquarius and your 8th House of Sex at that date, giving you time to celebrate your love with sensuality through the end of the year.</p>

        <h1>Friendships</h1>
            <p>What did you do on New Year's Eve, Cancer? While overall, 2024 is a chill year for your friendships, there may be unexpected shakeups or drama brewing during the first month of the year. That's because Uranus, the wild child of the zodiac, ruler of surprises, is retrograde when 2024 begins through January 27th, 2024, in the sign of Taurus in your 11th House of Friendship. Yes, this could indicate that you get frustrated with a friend (or they get annoyed at you) or that you even have a falling out with someone dear to your heart. However, it can also indicate welcome change. Most likely, an acquaintance surprises you with a thoughtful act of kindness that brings you closer. While not all change is bad, it can be stressful, so use more self-care than usual during the first month of the year.</p>
